# sewing_app
I made my first streamlit app, all taught by ChatGPT ver4.

It is simple app where you can...
- add your project to the database
- search your database with a keyword
(if no keyword is defined, it will show a list of all project on the database)
- delete unwanted project from database (as a result of search query)
